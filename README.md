I am a Software Engineer specializing in C++, Java and Python. I like working on large scale applications in Software Development and Android Development.

I have worked on various projects using different technologies like Java, Python and Augmented Reality to make my project interesting and useful.

Apart from that I love to learn new programming languages and technologies and solve difficult real world problems with modern technology and coding standards.
